        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Many students struggle to find suitable and affordable apartments near their universities or colleges. 
            This often results in a time-consuming and frustrating search process.</p>
        <p>We aim to aleviate this problem by creating an apartment finding app specifically designed for students at UW!.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow students to search for apartments by location, budget, and other preferences (tbd).</li>
            <li>Also, we will provide detailed information about available apartments, including rent, amenities, and location.</li>
            <li>Finally, it will enable students to save and compare apartments, and contact landlords or property managers directly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> One previous attempt to solve this problem is the website "<a href="https://apartmentsnearcampus.com/" target="_blank">ApartmentsNearCampus</a>" 
            This website is platform for students to search for apartments located near their campuses. The website offers a searchable 
            database of apartments, filters for specific preferences (e.g., price range, number of bedrooms), and lease signing. 
            But the website did not provide a function for past residents or current residents to write reviews for a apartment. 
            Which we think it is an important reference for a student approaching a new living place. And also this website is only made for off-canpus living
            near University of Iowa, our website is going to focus on UW.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Our target users of the application would be UW students, specifically those who are interested in housing near UW
            </li>
            <li>
                The user can view different apartments next to UW, and see detailed information about these apartments, like basic information, distance of the apartments from school, floor plans the apartments offered, location of the apartments on a map, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                One interactive feature is that users can wrote reviews for different apartments, and rate these apartments based on their experience (1-5 stars). 
            </li>
