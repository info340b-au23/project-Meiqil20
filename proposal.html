        <h1>Student Apartments Around UW</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Many students struggle to find suitable and affordable apartments near their universities or colleges. 
            This often results in a time-consuming and frustrating search process.</p>
        <p>We aim to aleviate this problem by creating an apartment finding app specifically designed for students at UW!.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow students to search for apartments by location, budget, and other preferences (tbd).</li>
            <li>Also, we will provide detailed information about available apartments, including rent, amenities, and location.</li>
            <li>Finally, it will enable students to save and compare apartments, and contact landlords or property managers directly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> One previous attempt to solve this problem is the website "<a href="https://apartmentsnearcampus.com/" target="_blank">ApartmentsNearCampus</a>" 
            This website is platform for students to search for apartments located near their campuses. The website offers a searchable 
            database of apartments, filters for specific preferences (e.g., price range, number of bedrooms), and lease signing. 
            But the website did not provide a function for past residents or current residents to write reviews for a apartment. 
            Which we think it is an important reference for a student approaching a new living place. And also this website is only made for off-canpus living
            near University of Iowa, our website is going to focus on UW.

    <section id="Proposed Application">
        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Our target users of the application would be UW students, specifically those who are interested in housing near UW
            </li>
            <li>
                The user can view different apartments next to UW, and see detailed information about these apartments, like basic information, distance of the apartments from school, floor plans the apartments offered, location of the apartments on a map, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                One interactive feature is that users can wrote reviews for different apartments, and rate these apartments based on their experience (1-5 stars). On the homepage of this website(Where users can check different apartments), users will be able to filter the resulting apartments based on distance, avg price, number of bedroom, etc. In addition, we plan to implement a search bar that will allow some simple level of searching. Also, some other features we may includes is: compare different apartments, sign in system and save any interested apartments.
            </li>
            <li>
                By using this website and its features described above like search, filtering, rating, comments, students will be able to compare apartments, find the best suitable housing choice for themselves, and eventually solve the housing dilemma they often face when transitioning to a new city for their studies. It empowers them with the tools and information needed to make informed decisions, ensuring a smoother transition and a more comfortable living experience during their academic journey.
