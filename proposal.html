        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Student living places, such as on-campus dorms or nearby apartments, are important to students college life. It relates to and affects many aspects of students' campus life. Some aspects are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Convenience:</b> Students who live on or near campus can easily access academic buildings, libraries, dining facilities, and other campus resources.</li>
            <li><b>Safety & Security:</b> On-campus residence halls can often provide more safer environment, they would have security measures such as ID card access systems, security guards, and surveillance cameras.</li>
            <li><b>Engagement:</b> Live near or on campus can make students more likely to participate in school activities, clubs, and events.</li>
            <li><b>Reduced Costs:</b> By living near campus, students can save on commuting costs, such as transportation costs and time costs that are spent traveling to and from campus.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on these value, we aim to creating an apartment finding app specifically designed for students at UW, making their housing search more convenient and efficient.</p>
        <p>The information technology problem in this space is the lack of a centralized platform that comprehensively gathers and presents information about     student apartments around campus. Students often struggle to find reliable, suitable and affordable apartments, making the search process time-consuming and frustrating.</p>
        <p> There is a website "<a href="https://apartmentsnearcampus.com/" target="_blank">ApartmentsNearCampus</a>", 
            which was a platform for students to search for apartments located near campus. The website offers a searchable 
            database of apartments, filters for specific preferences (e.g., price range, number of bedrooms), and lease signing. 
            But the website did not provide a function for past residents or current residents to write reviews for a apartment. 
            Which we think it is an important reference for a student approaching a new living place. And also this website is only 
            made for off-canpus living near the University of Iowa, our website is going to focus on UW.
